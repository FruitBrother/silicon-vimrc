# My vimrc file
 I used [amix/vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc) before.But I find that I can't
rememer its shortcut key and I don't need some of its config.So I make me vimrc
based on [amix/vimrc basic](https://github.com/amix/vimrc/blob/master/vimrcs/basic.vim) and
use vundle to install plugins I need one by one.
